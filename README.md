# Mint Classics Inventory Optimization Project

## Overview
This project is focused on optimizing the inventory management of Mint Classics, a retailer of classic model cars, by analyzing their stock levels, sales data, and warehouse performance. Using SQL-based data analysis, I identified potential improvements in stock reduction, product line optimization, and warehouse consolidation.

## Project Files
- [SQL Queries for Analysis]([./path-to-your-file.sql](https://github.com/audreyavm/Mint-Classics-Inventory-Analysis/blob/main/Project.Mint.Classics.csv)) - This file contains the SQL queries used to analyze inventory, sales, and profitability.
- [Recommendations Report]([./path-to-your-report.pdf](https://github.com/audreyavm/Mint-Classics-Inventory-Analysis/blob/main/Mint%20Classics%20Analysis%20Key%20Insights%20and%20Recommendations_.pdf)) - A detailed report with recommendations based on the findings from the SQL analysis.

## Approach and Thought Process

### Understanding the Business Problem
The goal of this project was to assess Mint Classics' inventory distribution across multiple warehouses and propose recommendations to optimize storage while maintaining timely service to customers. Specifically, the company was exploring the potential closure of one of its storage facilities.

### Data Exploration with SQL
I explored Mint Classics' relational database using SQL queries to extract key metrics such as total sales, stock levels, and profit margins. The data was grouped by month and region to uncover seasonal sales trends and regional product preferences. This allowed for more informed decision-making regarding stock adjustments and warehouse consolidation.

### Stock Reduction Simulation
A 5% stock reduction was simulated across all products to assess the potential impact on inventory and sales. This analysis helped identify products with low turnover, allowing the company to make informed decisions about reducing stock levels without compromising service efficiency.

### Warehouse Consolidation Strategy
By analyzing sales and inventory data, I identified that the **West Warehouse** held fewer products and had lower sales, making it a candidate for closure. Consolidating this warehouseâ€™s inventory into the more efficient **East Warehouse** could significantly reduce operational costs.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Warehouse Optimization**:
   - **Observation**: The **West Warehouse** had lower product variety and sales compared to the **East Warehouse**.
   - **Recommendation**: Consolidate the **West Warehouse** into the **East Warehouse** to reduce operational costs and increase efficiency.

2. **Stock Reduction**:
   - **Observation**: Products such as the **Dodge Coronet** and **Lancia Delta** had low sales and significant stock levels.
   - **Recommendation**: Reduce stock levels for low-selling products by 5-10% to free up space for higher-demand items.

3. **Product Line Optimization**:
   - **Observation**: High-margin products like the **Ferrari 360 Spider** and **Toyota Supra** consistently contributed to profitability.
   - **Recommendation**: Prioritize stocking and promoting high-margin products while considering the discontinuation of low-margin, low-selling products like the **Dodge Coronet**.

4. **Leverage Seasonal Trends & Sales Strategy**:
   - **Observation**: Seasonal sales trends showed fluctuations in product demand.
   - **Recommendation**: Use seasonal data to adjust inventory levels and promote high-demand products during peak months.

5. **Customer Focus**:
   - **Observation**: Sales data indicated regional preferences for certain products.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement region-specific marketing strategies to better target high-demand regions and reduce stock in underperforming areas.

## Conclusion
By implementing these recommendations, Mint Classics can reduce operational costs, optimize inventory management, and increase profitability. Consolidating underperforming warehouses, reducing stock levels for low-demand products, and focusing on high-margin items will help the company achieve its business objectives.
